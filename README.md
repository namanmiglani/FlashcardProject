# Flashcard Project

## Your new favourite school application

My project will be a flashcard application where the user will be able to create new flashcard sets, 
and then add question-answer pairs into the sets. The user will be able to view sets, the
questions in the sets, and the answer to these questions along with some, statistics about the chosen card.
It will allow users to mark whether they get the question correct, or incorrect when attempting the 
flashcards allowing them to  focus on the mastery of the set, while also letting them remove
flashcards  that they have already mastered. 

This application can be used by students to help them  prepare for assessments, by people at work who
need  to prepare for a presentation, by individuals learning a new language, and by many others who
are trying to learn something new, or attempting to gauge their understanding of a topic. I am 
designing this as I believe using active recall is a very effective way to learn new information,
and using flashcards is a technique I am familiar with as I have used them many times for school. Flashcards can
have many uses, and can be used by a wide variety of individuals helping them in their 
day-to-day lives. This application is also something I will be able to use once completed, 
to help me in future courses.
